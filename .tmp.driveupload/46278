  <p className={styles.paragraph}>
    <strong>SCHISM</strong> unfolds in a universe ruled by the strange laws of quantum uncertainty, where the very act of observation doesn’t merely reveal reality — it creates it. Consciousness and cosmos are entwined in a delicate dance, collapsing infinite possibilities into singular moments that shape destinies.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.paragraph}>
    As quantum entities watch, a young tribal woman named Esha begins to question the purpose of her existence. Her journey becomes a bridge between ancient human rites and the Eye at the centre of the Universe.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.paragraph}>
 At its heart lies the observer — both legend and mechanism, whose physics fracture time and space, compelling civilisations to confront the fragile boundary between fate and free will. Ancient gods stir within quantum fields as tribal souls awaken to vast cosmic truths, each choice sending ripples across existence.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.paragraph}>
    Melding hard science with raw human emotion, Schism probes how the observer effect mirrors our own decisions, how uncertainty breeds both choice and liberation, and how the quantum fabric of reality reflects the turmoil within us all.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.paragraph}>
    Inspired by Adrian Tchaikovsky’s grand vision and Iain M. Banks’ rich characterisation, Schism is a cerebral yet profoundly human journey into a universe where science and spirit collide — and where the future hinges on who. Or what. Is watching.
